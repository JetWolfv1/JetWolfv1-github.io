# Stay Woke: The Epic Battle For Precious Seconds

### Premise
This is a game about staying awake when time and your body are against you. But don't despair, you aren't alone! Collect beautiful, life-giving caffeine as it falls from the sky and into your mug. But beware, for not everything that goes in your mug will help you.
